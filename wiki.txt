\sectionIntroductio
Discrete vs. Continuous structures
   	
   * Objects in discrete structures are individual and separable  	
   * An intuitive analogy is that discrete structures focus on individual trees in the forest whereas continuous structures care about the landscape airplane view.  	
   * Discrete structure courses can be called "computer science semantics" in other universities. Mathematics for computer science.  	
   * Naive examples  	   		
      * Counting techniques: There are two ice cream shops. One sells 20 different flavours whereas the other offers 1000 different combinations of three flavours. Which one has the most possible combinations of three flavours?  		
      * Cryptography: Two parties want to communicate securely over an insecure channel. Can they do it? Yes, using number theory. Discrete Structures are used in cryptography (what this question is about), coding theorem (compression of data) and optimization.  		
      * Graph Theory: Suppose you have 6 cities and you want to connect them with roads joining the least possible number of pairs, so that every pair is connected, perhaps indirectly. In how many ways can we connect these cities using 5 roads?  	  	
   * Before we address these problems, we must agree upon a language to formalize them.  

---++ Sets

---+++ Definition
A set is a collection of distinct objects which are called the elements of the set.

Examples: We use a capital letter for sets.
   	
   * $A = \ Alice, Bob, Claire, Eve \$  	
   * $B = \ a, e, i, o, u \ = \ o, i, e, a, u\$  	
   * $\mathb = \1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\$ (natural numbers)  	
   * $\mathb = \.., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..\$ (integers)  	
   * $\emptyset = \\ $ (no elements, note: $\\emptyset \ \neq \emptyset \$)  	
   * If x is an element of A we write $x \in A$ which is read "belongs", "is an element of" or "is in" e.g. $Alice \in A, Alice \notin \mathb$  	
   * We say that X is a subset of a set Y if for every $z \in X$ we have $z \in Y$ Notation: $X \subseteq Y$.  	
   * $\emptyset \subseteq \1,2,3,4,5\ \subseteq \mathb \subseteq \mathb \subseteq \mathb \subseteq \mathb $  

---+++ Operations on sets

$U = \1,2,3,4,5,6 .. 10\ = \ x \in \mathb: x \leq 10\$

$A = \2,4,6,8,10\ = \x \in U: x $ is even$ \$

$B = \2,3,5,7\ = \x \in U: x $ is prime$ \$

An intersection $A \cap B$ is a set of all elements belonging to both A or B: $A \cap B = \2\$

A union $A \cup B$ is a set of all elements belonging to either A or B: $A \cap B = \2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10\$

$|A| = 5, |B| = 4, |A \cap B| = 1, |A \cup B| = 8 |\emptyset| = 0, |\mathb| = \infty$

$A - B$: all elements of A which do not belong to B $\x : x \in A, x \notin B\$

$A \oplus B, A \triangle B$: symmetric difference, set of all elements belonging to exactly one of A and B

---+++ Venn Diagrams

A way of depicting all possible relations between a collection of sets. For a set A, $|A|$ denotes the number of elements in it. 

Typically, Venn diagrams are useful for 2 or 3 sets.

---+++ Theorems

   	
   * $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$  	   		
      * Fact: For any two finites sets $|A| + |B| = |A \cap B| + |A \cup B|$  		
      * Proof:  		  			
      * $x \in A \cap (B \cup C)$ then $x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$  			   				
         * $x \in A$ and $(x \in B$ or $x \in C)$  				
         * if $x \in B$ then $x \in (A \cap B)$ therefore $x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$  				
         * if $x \in C$ then $x \in (A \cap C)$ therefore $x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$  			  			
      * $x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ then $x \in A \cap (B \cup C)$  				   					
         * $x \in (A \cap B)$ therefore $x \in A$ and $x \in (B \cup C)$  				  		    	  		
   * $A \oplus B = (A \cup B)-(A \cap B) = (A - B) \cup (B - A)$

---++ Logic

Way of formally organizing knowledge studies inference rules i.e. which arguments are valid and which are fallacies.

---+++ Propositional Calculus

A proposition is a statement (sentence) which is either true or false.

Some examples:
   	
   * $2 + 2 = 4 \to$ true  	
   * $2+3 = 7 \to$ false  	
   * "If it is sunny tomorrow, I will go to the beach." $\to$ valid proposition  	
   * "What is going on?" $\to$ not a proposition  	
   * "Stop at the red light" $\to$ not a proposition  	
   * We are given 4 cards. Each card has a letter (A-Z) on one side, a number (0-9) on the other side. "If a card has a vowel on one side then it has an even number on the other" Two ways to refute this proposition: Either turn over a vowel card and find an odd number. Or turn over an odd number and find a vowel.  

---+++ Notation
   	
   * Letters will be used to denote statements: p, q, r  	
   * $p \wedge q$: "and", "conjunction", "p and q" (are both true)  	
   * $p \vee q$: "or", "disjunction", "either p or q" (is true)  	
   * $\neg p$: "not", "p is false"	  

---+++ Truth Tables

---+++ Rules of Logic


	
* Double negation: $\neg (\neg p) \leftrightarrow p$
	
* Indempotent rules: $p \wedge p \leftrightarrow p \qquad p \vee p \leftrightarrow p$
	
* Absorption rules: $p \wedge (p \vee q) \leftrightarrow p \qquad p \vee (p \wedge q) \leftrightarrow p$
	
* Commutative rules: $p \wedge q \leftrightarrow q \wedge p \qquad p \vee q \leftrightarrow q \vee p $
	
* Associative rules: $p \wedge (q \wedge r) \leftrightarrow (q \wedge p) \wedge r \qquad p \vee (q \vee r)\leftrightarrow (p \vee q) \vee r$
%% Friday Sept 9th 2011
	
* Distributive rules: $p \wedge (q \vee r) \leftrightarrow (p \wedge q) \vee (p \wedge r) \qquad p \vee (q \wedge r) \leftrightarrow (p \vee q) \wedge (p \vee r)$
	
* De Morgan's rule: $\neg((\neg p) \vee (\neg q)) \leftrightarrow p \wedge q \qquad \neg((\neg p) \wedge (\neg q)) \leftrightarrow p \vee q$


	$p \vee (\neg ((\neg p) \wedge (\neg q))) \leftrightarrow  p \vee (p \vee q) \leftrightarrow (p \vee p) \vee q \leftrightarrow p \vee q$



---++++ Conditional Statements


	
* $p \to q$
	   	
   * Theorem: if (an assumption holds), then (the conclusion holds).  	
   * Implication: "if p then q"
   		p = "a, b, \& c are two sides and the hypthenuse of a triangle"
   		q = "$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$"  	
   * $p \to q$ "If p then q" p implies q, p is sufficient for q
   		$(p \to q) \leftrightarrow (q \vee (\neg p))$  		% insert truth table 1  	
   * Examples:   		   			
      * "If the Riemann hypothesis is true then 2 + 2 = 4" TRUE
   			p = "the Riemann hypothesis"
   			q = "2+2=4"
   			True proposition is implied by any proposition.  			
      * "If pigs can fly then pigs can get sun burned" TRUE
   			False statement implies any statement  			
      * "If 2+2 =4 then pigs can fly" FALSE
   			The implication is false only if the assumption holds and the conclusion does not.  		  		% insert truth table 2  	
   * $p \to q \leftrightarrow (\neg p) \to (\neg q)$  	
   * $(p \to q) \wedge (q \to p) \leftrightarrow (p \leftrightarrow q)$  	


\paragrapPuzzl

There are three boxes A, B, C. Exactly one contains gold in it.
   	
   * Box A: Gold is not in this box  	
   * Box B: Gold is no in this box  	
   * Box C: Gold is in box A  
Exactly one of these propositions is true. Where is the gold?
Let us formalize the propositions.
   	
   * p:  "Gold is in box A"  	
   * q:  "Gold is in box B"  	
   * r:  "Gold is in box C"  	
   * Box A: $q \vee r$  	
   * Box B: $p \vee r$  	
   * Box C: p  	
   * $p \to (p \vee r)$  	
   * $\neg (p \vee r) \to q$

---+++ Tautologies \& Contradictions

\paragrapDefinitio
   	
   * A *tautology*  is a statement that is always true (the rightmost column of the corresponding truth table has T in every row) e.g. $p \vee (\neg p)$  	
   * A *contradiction*  is a statement that is always false e.g. $p \wedge (\neg p)$  

\paragrapNotatio
   	
   * 1 denotes a tautology  	
   * 0 denotes a contradiction  	
   * $1 \vee p \leftrightarrow 1$  	
   * $0 \vee p \leftrightarrow p$  	
   * $1 \wedge p \leftrightarrow p$  	
   * $0 \wedge p \leftrightarrow 0$  

   
   * $p \wedge (p \vee q)$
   | l | l | l | l |    p & 1 & $p \vee q$  & $p \wedge (p \vee q)$
     T & T & T & T 
     T & F & T & T 
     F & T & T & F 
     F & F & F & F 
    
   $\to$ Not a tautology and not a contradiction 
   $p \wedge (p \vee q) \leftrightarrow p$ (one of the rules)  
   * $p \vee (p \wedge q) \vee (p \to q) \leftrightarrow (p \vee (p \wedge q)) \vee (p \to q)$ 
   $(p \to q) \leftrightarrow (\neg p) \vee q \leftrightarrow p \vee (p \to q)$
   $\leftrightarrow p \vee ((\neg p) \vee q) (absorption)$
   $\leftrightarrow (p \vee (\neg p))\vee q$
   $\leftrightarrow 1 \vee q \leftrightarrow 1$  

---+++ Proofs
   	
   * $(p \to q) \wedge (q \to r) \to (p \to r)$ (always true)  	
   * Implication is transitive: $p \to q \to r$  	
   * A *proof*  of a conclusion q given premise p is a sequence of implications (valid) $p \to p_2 \to p_3 \to .. \to p_k \to q$  	
   * To prove $(p \leftrightarrow q)$ 
   		$\qquad (p \leftrightarrow q) \leftrightarrow (p \to q) \wedge (q \to p)$  	
   * Theorem: Let p(x) be a polynomial then p(0) = 0 if and only if p(x) = x q(x) for some polynomial q(x)  	
   * Proof: "p(0) = 0" and "p(x) = x q(x) for some polynomial q(x)"  	  		
   * $p(x) = a_nx^n + an -xn- + ... + a_1x + a_0$ 
   			$p(0) = 0 \to a_0 = 0 \to$ 
   			$p(x) = a_nx^n + an -xn- + ... + a_1x \to$ 
   			$p(x) = x(a_nxn- + an -xn- + ... + a_1$ 
   			$p(x) = xq(x)$ 
   			$q(x) = a)nxn- + an-xn- + ... + a_2$ 
   			True so proven.  		
   * $p(x) = x q(x) \to p(0) = 0 \cdot q(0) \to q(0) = 0$  	  	
   * Proof by contradiction: $(p \to q) \leftrightarrow ((\neg q)\to (\neg p))$  	
   * Pigeonhole principle: We place an objects into m bins. If $n &gt; m$ then some bin contains at least 2 objects.  	
   * Proof: p = "$n &gt; m$" and q = "Some bin contains at least 2 objects" 
   	$\neg q$ = "every bin contains at most 1 object" 
   	$\neg p$ = "$n \leq m$"  	$\neg q \to\ \neg p$ is trivial  	
   * Theorem: There are infinitely many prime numbers 
   		Direct proof of this theorem is unlikely, there is no known simple formula producing prime numbers  	
   * Proof: Assume $\neg p$. There are infinitely many prime numbers $p_1, p_2, p_3 .. p_k$ 
   	Consider $p = p_1p_2...p_k + 1$  	Every integer greater than 1 is divisible by a prime. (Prime number is the integer divisible by only 1 and itself).  	Suppose $p = p_im$ for some $1 \leq i \leq k$ and an integer m, then $p_i(p_1p_2...pi-pi+...p_k) + 1 = p_im$  	$p_i(m - p_1p_2..p_k) = 1$ (except $p_1$)  	"1 is divisible by $p_i$, a contradiction"

A logical circuit has size equal to the number of gates in it and depth equal to the length (or number of gates) of the longest path from an input to the final output.

Given a boolean formula, what is the minimum size (or depth) of a circuit necessary to compute it?
(depth is frequently assumed to be constant).

Given a circuit C with inputs $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$

Can we test if C is always a contradiction? The answer is trivially yes, if we test all possible inputs. It would take $2^n$.

---++ Polytime algorithms P\# NP conjecture

---+++ Definition
Given algorithm A its running time $t_A(n) =$ maximum number of steps the algorithm can require on inputs of size n

A is a *polynomial time*  algorithm if $t_A(n)$ is polynomially bounded ($t_A(n)=O(n^2)) \dbl$ fast, efficient

P is class of problem which allow polynomial time algorithms.

\paragrapExample


	
* Evaluating the median of a set of numbers
	   		
   * Problem: $x_1, x_2, .., x_n \leftarrow$ Input  		
   * Question: decide whether the median of the list is $\leq 1000$  		
   * Algorithm:   		   			
      * Sort the list going once through the list ($\leq n$ steps) we can find smallest $x_i$  			
      * Repeat to find the second smallest number and so on  			
      * Requires $O(n^2)$ time to sort  			
      * Check if $x\fran ( x\fran)$ is at most 1000 (roughly $n^2$ steps polytime).  		  	
	
* Multiplication
		   			
   * Input: $2 n$ digit numbers  			
   * Output: $a \times b$  			\\ roughly $n^2$ steps  		
	
* Problem Factoring
		   			
   * Input: a composite number C  			
   * Output: Find natural numbers $a, b &gt; 1, c = a \times b$  			
   * Brute-Force search: Try all prime numbers up to C. Time: $10n/ \to$ exponential time algorithm  			
   * RSA ran contests until 2007 offering prizes for factoring (roughly 20 computer years for factoring 200 digit numbers)  		


---+++ NP problems (non-deterministic polynomial time)

   \item  A *decision problem*  is a problem with a yes/no answer.  Example:   	   	
      * Input: a combinatorial circuit (with n inputs)  	
      * Output: Is C *not*  a contradiction?  	  \item  A decision problem is in the class NP if a "yes" answer always has a certificate which can be verified in polynomial time.  \item  A problem is in NP when the answer is positive. A magician can quickly convince you that it is e.g. "testing that a circuit is not a contradiction" is in NP.  \item  If there exists a set of values for inputs so that the circuit outputs 1 (or T) then given this collection of inputs verifying that it works is fast.  

\paragrapExample


* Factoring:
	   	
   * Input: n digit number  	
   * output: Is this number composite and if it is, factor it.  	

* Traveling Salesman problem:
	   	
   * Input: Collection of n cities and distances between them  	
   * Travelling salesman tour: An ordering of cities $c_1 \to c_2 \to ... \to c_n$ visiting each city once  	
   * Question: Is there a tour of total length $\leq 1000$ miles $\to$ is in NP  	


---+++ $P \neq NP$

There exist problems which cannot be solved efficiently but for which a positive answer can be verified efficiently. There exists problems for which brute-force search is essentially the best possible strategy. If there are problems where you need a magician, then it is NP.

If there exists a problem in NP but not in P (if the conjecture is true) then testing if a circuit is a contradiction, travelling salesman problem, and a very large class of similar problems are all not in P

If P = NP then airline scheduling, protein folding, packing boxes, finding short proof for theorems all can be done efficiently but certain cryptography becomes impossible.

The universal opinion is that $P \neq NP$

---+++ Scott Aovonson's reasons for $P \neq NP$

Empirical: Problems in NP remain heuristically hard, however problems which are now known to be in P (linear programming, primality testing) but efficient heuristics existed long before.

---+++ Divisibility Problem
We want to prove the following theorem:
   
   * Any collection of n+1 numbers chosen from the set \1,2,...,2n\ contains two numbers so that one is divisible by the other.  
   * $\forall n \in \mathb (\forall s \subseteq \1,2,...,2n\ (|S| = n + 1) \to \exists a,b \in S ((a | b) \wedge (a + b)))$  

\paragrapReminder: the pigeonhole principl 

If $n+1$ objects are placed into n boxes then some box contains $\geq 2$ objects. To apply the principle we want to partition $\1,2,...,2n\$ into n subjects. 

\paragrapPartitio We say that a collection $A_1, A_2, ... A_k$ of subsets of a set B is a *partition*  of B if

	
* $\forall i,j : 1 \leq i &lt; \leq k \qquad A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ (no element of B belongs to two different parts)
	
* $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_k = B$


Example: \1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\ \qquad \1,2,4,6,8\ , \3, 5\ , \7\

\paragrapProo By the pigeonhole principle it suffices to find a partition $A_1, A_2, ... A_n$ of \1,2,...,2n\ so that $(\forall i (\forall a,b \in A_i (a|b \vee b|a)))$

Here is a construction:
$A_i = \(2i + 1), 2(2i -1), 4(2i -1), ..., 2^m(2i-1)\$ up to maximum m: $2^m (2i-1) \leq 2n$


* $A_i$ satisfies the desired property for all i

* $A_1, A_2, .., A_n$ is a partition of \1,2,...,2n\ 


Ever positive integer can be uniquely written in a form $2^m(2i - 1)$ for some $i \geq 1, m \geq 0$


Note: Is it true for some n:
"Every collection of n numbers chosen from \1,2,...,2n\ contains 2 numbers one dividing the other"?

Counter-example: $n = 2 \quad \1,2,3,4\ \to \3,4\$

For a collection of people any two of them either have met or haven't . A club is a group of people who have pairwise met each other. A group of strangers is a group of people who pairwise have not met each other

Theorem: In any collection of 6 people rhwew is either a club of 3 people or a group of 3 strangers.

Proof Let x be one of the people in the collection. The following cases apply

	
* x has at least 3 acquaintances
	
		
* Some two of acquaintances of x, say y \& z know each other. Then \x, y, z\ form a club.
		
* No two acquaintances of x know each other. Then they form a group of strangers.
	
	
* x has at most 2 acquaintances there one ate least 3 people


---++ Social Choice Function

---+++ Definition
3 candidates A, B \& C:
   	
   * 49\% of electorate A &gt; B &gt; C  	
   * 48 \% of electorate B &gt; A &gt; C  	
   * 3\% of electorate C &gt; B &gt; A  

Given a collection of voters $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ and several candidates A, B, C, D, ...

Each voter ranks the candidates according to his preferences:

$A &gt;v_ B &gt;v_ C &gt;v_ D \qquad &gt;v_ is the ordering produced by the it voter$

\paragrapPermutatio

(A, D, B, C) of the set of candidates \A, B, C, D \

Social choice function takes as an input voter's ordering and produces a consensus ordering and produces a consensus ordering $f(&gt;v_,&gt;v_,,...,&gt;v_) = \quad &gt;$

What conditions should a good SCF satisfy?

	
* *Unanimity* : If every voter prefers $\alpha$ to $\beta$ then the consensus ordering must rank $\alpha$ above $\beta$ 


	$(\forall \vee (\alpha &gt; \beta)) \to (\alpha &gt; \beta)$
	
* *Independence on irrelevant alternatives (IAA)* 
	The final relative ordering of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ should depend only on relative orderings of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (If a candidate withdraws from election this doesn't affect the order of others). 


Which social choice functions satisfy these properties?

What happens with majority? $\alpha &gt; \beta$ if more than half of the voters prefer $\alpha$ to $\beta$:
   	
   * $v_1 : A &gt;v_ B &gt;v_ C $  	
   * $v_2 : C &gt;v_ A &gt;v_ B $  	
   * $v_3 : B &gt;v_ C &gt;v_ A $  

How does this work? There is a conflict here...

Dictatorship: For some fixed voter d we have ($\alpha &gt; \beta$) if and only if ($\alpha &gt;^d \beta$)

Unanimity $\wedge$ IIA $\to$ dictatorship

Let $&gt;$ satisfy these two properties $\beta$ is called a polarizing candidate if every voter ranks him.her at the very top or the very bottom of the list.

*Claim*  A polarizing candidate ranks first or last in the consensus ordering $&gt;$

*Proof*  Suppose not $\alpha &gt; \beta &gt; \gamma $ where $\beta$ is a polarizing candidate

| l | l | l | l |
  $\beta$ & $\beta$ & $\alpha$  & $\gamma$


  $\alpha$ & $\gamma$ & $\gamma$  & $\alpha$


  $\gamma$ & $\alpha$ & $\beta$  & $\beta$




Switch $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ in voter's preferences so that every voter prefers $\gamma$ to $\alpha$. We should still have $\alpha &gt; \beta &gt; \gamma$ because relative positions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and relative positions of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are unchanged. By unanimity we should now have $\gamma &gt; \alpha$ (contradiction QED)


Choose a candidate $\beta$

Theorem
Every positive integer bigger than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (being prime counts).

Statement
P(n) = "If n &gt; 1, then n can be expressed as product of prime numbers

C = $\n \in \mathb : n &gt; 1$ n can be expressed as such a product\

Choose $n_0$ to be a smallest element of C (We are using proof by contradiction)

   	
   * Case 1: $n_0$ is prime 
   	This can't happen. $n_0$ by itself would be a valid product  	
   * Case 2: $n_0$ is not prime 
   	      $n_0 = ab \qquad 1 &lt; a,b &lt; n_0 \qquad a,b \in \mathb$ 
   	      Therefore as $a, b \notin C$, so $a = p_1p_2p_3...p_k \quad p_i$ is prime and   	      						$b = q_1q_2 ... q_i \quad q_j$ is prime 
   	       $n = p_1p_2p_3...p_k . q_1q_2q_3...q_k \quad$ So n is a product of primes

The formula is true for n_0 -1 \qquad (n_0 \neq 1)

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 2(n_0 -1) -1 = (n_0 - 1)^2

So 1 + 3 + 5  + ...+ (2n-1) = (n_0 -1)^2 + 2n_0 -1

Expression of a positive as product of primes is called prime factorization. We have shown that every integer greater than 1 admits a prime factorization.

\paragrapThe fundamental theorem of arithmeti Every integer greater than 1 admits unique prime factorization

Proof using contradiction: Suppose some n admits at least two distinct prime factorizations. Choose the minimum such n.
n = p_1p_2p_3...p_k = q_q1_2...q_l

We may assume that p_1 is the smallest prime among all the primes p_i and q_j

Suppose p_1 = q_1 then \franp_ = p_2...p_i = q_2 ... q_l
It is a smaller number admitting two different factorizations

So p_1 &lt; q_1 so q1 = xp_1 + r \qquad 0 \leq r \leq p_1
pn = (xp_1 + r )q_2 ... q_i also we may assume q_2, q_3 , ... q_l \neq p_1

n is divisible by p_1

           $d_1 | b$ is trivial since $d_1$ is gcd(a, b) 
           $r = a - qb$ a is divisble by $d_1$ and b is divisible by $d_1$ therefore $d_1$ divides r      
   * $d_2 \leq d_1$ It is enough to show that $d_2 | a$ and $d_2 | b$
           $d_2| b$ is trivial 
           $a = r + qb$ since $d_2$ is a divisor of r and b then $d_2$ is a linear combination of r and b and $d_2 | a$

---+++ Statement of Euclid's algorithm
GCD(a, b) 


*Input* : integers a \& b (in binary)
*Steps* :



    
* $a \geq b$
    
* Divide with remainder $a = qb + r, 0 \leq r &lt; b$
    
* $If r = 0 \to *output* : b$
    
* Otherwise, run GCD(b,r)


---+++ Analysis of Euclid's algorithm
    
        
* It is valid by part 5 of the preceding theorem ($a = qb + r \to gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)$)
        
* It terminates in at most a + b  $\to$ in each recursive step we replace a by r.


            So the sum of the inputs decreases.
        
* Is it efficient (polytime)?


            We want to show that it terminates in $O((log a + log b)^k)$
                       
   * *Claim* : $a = qb + r \qquad 0 \leq r \leq b, a \geq b$ then $ab \geq 2br$              
   * *Proof* : We need to show that $a\geq 2r$ 
                   $q \geq 1 \to a \geq b+r \to a \geq r+r = 2r$              
   * The claim implies that the product of the inputs is reduced by at least a factor of 2 in each step. 
                   So there are at most $log (ab) steps in recursion 
                   $\log (ab) = \log a + \log b \to$ *linear algorithm*           
    

---+++ Expressing gcd(a,b) as a linear combination of a \& b
$gcd(962, 230) = \qquad 962 = 4 \cdot 230 + 42


gcd(230, 42) = \qquad 230 = 5 \cdot 42 + 20


gcd(42, 20) = \qquad 42 = 20 \cdot + 2


gcd(20, 2) =

$


2 &= 42 - 2 \cdot 20 


&= 42 - 2 \cdot (230 - 5 \cdot 42)


&= 11 \cdot 42 - 2 \cdot 230


&= 11 \cdot (962 - 4 \cdot 230) - 2 \cdot 230


&= 11 \cdot 962 - 46 \cdot 230
